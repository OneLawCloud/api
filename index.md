# OneLaw Cloud API

> ⚠️ **Draft:** This page is a work in progress and may change.

The OneLaw Cloud API provides secure, standards-based access to the OneLaw Cloud legal practice management platform. It enables approved developers and partners to build integrations, automations, and extensions that connect OneLaw with other systems and services.

Built on RESTful principles and using OAuth 2.0 for authentication, the API exposes key entities such as clients, matters, time entries, and documents. Each law firm's data is securely isolated, and all access is governed by partnership agreements to ensure compliance and data protection.

This documentation introduces the API's structure, authentication model, and usage guidelines to help you integrate confidently and effectively with OneLaw Cloud.
